Finetuning with Metatrain
Example 01 - Full Finetuning


In this example we fully finetune the PET-MAD Universal potential to a Li3PS4 dataset, meaning that allow the modification of all model weights during training.
To do this, please do:

1) Run 'bash finetune.sh'. This will train the model after loading the PET-MAD checkpoint. The training process will take several minutes.
   Please have a look at options.yaml to see how the finetuning is defined.
2) Run 'bash eval.sh'. This will export the PET-MAD model from the checkpoint and evaluate it in two datasets: Li3PS4 and MAD. 
3) Look at the computed energies with 'jupyter-notebook inspect-errors.ipynb'. It will generate you parity plots of the model with the DFT data of the respective datasets. This will also save the generated parity plots as pngs.

If you want to delete the generated files, please run 'bash clean.sh'.
