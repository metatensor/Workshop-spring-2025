Finetuning with Metatrain
Example 00 


In this example we evaluate the PET-MAD Universal potential using metatrain.
To do this, please do:

1) Run 'bash eval.sh'. This will export the PET-MAD model from the checkpoint and evaluate it in two datasets: Li3PS4 and MAD 
2) Look at the computed energies with 'jupyter-notebook inspect-errors.ipynb'. It will generate you parity plots of the model with the DFT data of the respective datasets. This will also save the generated parity plots as pngs.

If you want to delete the generated files, please run 'bash clean.sh'.
