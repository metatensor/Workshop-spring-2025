# Defining and training custom atomstic machine learning model with metatensor and metatomic

TODO


## Running the tutorials

You should go through the different notebooks in this repository in order.
Everytime you see this icon

![task icon](img/clipboard.png)

This means you need to modify the code to make it work and make a small test
pass. All the modifications should only require basic Python knowledge, and no
specific PyTorch/metatensor/metatomic knowledge.

## Installation

TODO

```bash
cd metatensor-metatomic/

python3 -m venv virtualenv
source ./virtualenv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip

pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```
